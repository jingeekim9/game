# Butterfly Game

## The purpose of this game is to test if monkeys can find the butterfly. The butterfly will appear for two seconds, and within that time, the butterfly must be pressed. If the butterfly is pressed, the score will increase by one. Every time the score increases, the time the butterfly is shown will decrease.


## If a space that does not contain a butterfly is pressed or the butterfly is not pressed within the time limit, you will have lost the game.
