# Corsi Block Game

## Corsi Block Game is a memory game where, depending on the current level you are in, a certain number of blue boxes will randomly appear on the screen. When the blue boxes are done appearing then you must press on the spaces that the blue box appeared in the same order. If you pressed on the current spaces in the correct order, then you will move on to the next level and blue boxes will appear again. The higher level you are in, the more blue boxes appear.
